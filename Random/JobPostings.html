		<h3>We’re always growing.</h3>
		<p>Most people think of Valve as a company that makes video games&#151;<br/>and we are.  But we also built the software that powers those games and the platform that lets millions of fans play, share, modify, and build communities around more than 5,000 titles.  That makes us a full-spectrum entertainment studio.  As such, our search for talent has taken us beyond the game industry and into the fields of architecture, economics, psychology, and industrial design.  We’re not just growing.  We’re diversifying.  Where to next?  You tell us.  We’re after talented people with original ideas and the passion to realize them.</p>
